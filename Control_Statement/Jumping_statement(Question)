1.WAP to print all natural numbers from 1 to 20, skipping the numbers that are divisible by 3.
Use the continue statement to skip over numbers that meet the condition.

2.WAP to print the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci series that are greater than 0 and less than 100.
Use a loop to generate the Fibonacci series and break the loop once you have printed 10 numbers.

3.WAP to find the first 5 prime numbers less than 100.
Use break to exit your loop once you have found 5 prime numbers.

4.WAP to print the multiplication table of a given number but skip any multiple that is a multiple of 8.
Use the continue statement to skip printing those multiples.

5.WAP to sum all natural numbers from 1 to 100, but break the loop if the sum exceeds 200.
Use the break statement to exit the loop when the sum exceeds the threshold.

6.WAP to print the first 20 odd numbers, but stop if you encounter a number that is greater than 40.
Use the break statement to break out of the loop when the condition is met.

7.WAP to print all numbers from 1 to 30, but skip any number that ends with a 5.
Use continue to skip numbers that satisfy this condition.

8.WAP to print all integers from 1 to 50, but stop the process if the number is a perfect square (1, 4, 9, 16, etc.).
Use break when you reach a perfect square.

9.WAP to find the first 5 even numbers in a loop incrementing by 2 each step but stop if the next even number is greater than 50.
Use break to stop before printing any number greater than 50.

10.WAP to print all prime numbers between 1 and 50, but continue to the next number if the current number is even (except for 2).
Use continue to skip even numbers.
